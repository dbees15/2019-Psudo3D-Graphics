# 2019-Psudo3D-Graphics
## Description
Implementation of a basic raycasting engine which projects a 2D level into a 3D image. Each column of pixels on the screen represents a ray casted from a camera located in the 2D level. The height of the column depends on the length of the ray at a collision. The longer the ray length, the shorter the column, simulating a distant object

Included is the Code::Blocks project files. Compile main.cpp with C++11. An executable for the project is found in Raycast/bin/Debug. To correctly display the program, resize the console window to 240 x 80 and select a smaller font such as 8x8
